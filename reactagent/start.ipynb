Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \\n    (1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\\n    (2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\\n    (3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\\n    Here are some examples.\\n    \\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \\nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: [\\'Adam Clayton Powell III\\', \\'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)\\', \\'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building\\', \\'Isabel Washington Powell\\', \\'Adam Powell\\', \\'Adam Clayton Powell (film)\\', \\'Giancarlo Esposito\\'].\\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.
