It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny..

The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the Texas Panhandle.[5] The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.[6] From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,500 to 6,000 ft (460 to 1,830 m).[3]. The term \"Great Plains\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[7] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[8] Today, the term \"High Plains\" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..\n",

In December 2015, Goertz released a concept album based on the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, Sad Dance Songs, with the album's cover emulating the animation and logo of the series.[3][4] The album was made possible through Kickstarter.[5] She is co-host, along with Julia Prescott, of Everything's Coming Up Simpsons (formerly Everything's Coming Up Podcast), a podcast dedicated to The Simpsons.. Subjects of her songs have included the film The Room, the character Milhouse from the television show The Simpsons, and the game Dungeons & Dragons.[6] Her style has been compared to that of Bo Burnham.[7].\n",
